Roadmap
======

0.0.1
-----
Plan for initial commit:

* configurability via config
  * branches should be configurable
* index locking when the commit slug is only "index" (do not generate a TOC)
* a standard template
* a way of adding static assets (at least style sheets first)
* feed generation

0.0.2
-----
* an "event-driven directory structure" for hooks, much more granular, more control
* structuring data as toml before handing it over to plugins
* the pipeline is in place
* the blog is just one component of the pipeline and can be deactivated
* Handling merges: blog only the merge commit, when commit into master, and only if there is something to blog.
* Handling older versions of the same slug (same file on disk)

0.0.3
-----
* A smooth handling of the pipeline
* Allow referencing static assets from anywhere in the project (and copy them to the blogging branch)
* Allow referencing code snippets (treeish:file:line-start[:+no-lines/lines-end])

0.0.4
-----
* Add new plugins for the pipeline
  * integrate diffs
  * integrate changelog

0.0.5
-----
* rewrite in rust
* event-driven architecture
* ways of grouping and categorising articles
  * pave the road to more wiki-like sites

0.0.6
-----
* plugin ecosystem, publishing, versioning, dependencies

1.0.0
-----
* It should be smarter about locating identifiers in the actual code (and creating links as needed).
